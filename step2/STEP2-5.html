  <h1> CHAOTIC </h1>
  <div id="YO">

  <p> I sat down at the small table in the kitchen of my 1960s apartment,<br> nestled on the top floor of a building<br> in a vibrant central neighbourhood of Tehran, and I did something I had done <br>thousands of times previously. I opened my laptop and posted to my new blog. This, though,<br> was the first time in six years. And it nearly broke my heart.</p>

<p>A few weeks earlier, I'd been abruptly pardoned and freed from Evin prison in <br>northern Tehran. I had been expecting to spend most of my life in those cells: In November 2008,<br> I'd been sentenced to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things I'd written on my blog.But the moment,<br> when it came, was unexpected. I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with one of<br> my fellow inmates, and came back to the room I shared with a<br> dozen other men. We were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor announcer - <br>another prisoner - filled all the rooms and corridors. In his flat voice,<br> he announced in Persian: "Dear fellow inmates, the bird <br>of luck has once again sat on one fellow inmate's shoulders. Mr. Hossein Derakhshan,<br> as of this moment, you are free." That evening was the first time that I went out of those doors as a free man.<br> Everything felt new: The chill autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby bridge,<br> the smell, the colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life.Around me,<br> I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I'd been used to. An influx of new,<br> shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with.<br> New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for<br> Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with<br> dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. <br>They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once<br> normal life gets taken away from you.</p>
