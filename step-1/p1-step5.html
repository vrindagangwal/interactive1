	<h1><font face="didot" color="orange"> SEVEN MONTHS AGO,</h1>
	<p> <i>I sat down at the small table in the kitchen of my 1960s apartment, nestled on the top floor of<br> a building in a vibrant central neighbourhood of Tehran, and I did something I had done <br>thousands of times previously. I opened my laptop and posted to my new blog. <br>This, though, was the first time in six years. And it nearly broke my heart.<br>A few weeks earlier, I'd been abruptly pardoned and freed from Evin prison<br> in northern Tehran. I had been expecting to spend most of my life in those cells:<br> In November 2008, I'd been sentenced to nearly 20 years in jail, mostly for things I'd written on my blog.<br>But the moment, when it came, was unexpected. I smoked a cigarette in the kitchen with one of<br> my fellow inmates, and came back to the room I shared with a dozen other men.<br> We were sharing a cup of tea when the voice of the floor announcer - another prisoner - filled all<br> the rooms and corridors. In his flat voice, he announced in Persian: <i><big style="color:white">"Dear fellow inmates, the bird of luck has<br> once again sat on one fellow inmate's shoulders. Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, as of this moment, you are free."</big><br>"That evening was the first time that I went out of those doors as a free man. Everything felt new:<br> The chill autumn breeze, the traffic noise from a nearby bridge, the smell, the <br>colors of the city I had lived in for most of my life.Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one<br> I'd been used to. An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced <br>the charming little houses I was familiar with. New roads, new highways, hordes of<br> invasive SUVs. Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs.<br> Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds<br> of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. They were the <br>kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice<br> once normal life gets taken away from you.</i></p>
